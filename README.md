# Neural Head Reconstruction (Diploma Thesis)

**Topic:** Novel View Synthesis (NVS) for Human Heads using Sparse Camera Views.  
**Methodology:** Transitioning from 2D Image Warping to Differentiable Gaussian Splatting.

## 📖 Overview

This repository documents the research and development pipeline for my Diploma Thesis. The goal is to reconstruct a photorealistic 3D representation of a human head using a minimal number of camera inputs (1 to 4 views) and allow for real-time rendering.

The project represents a technological evolution from traditional Computer Vision techniques (Delaunay Triangulation, Affine Warping) to modern AI-driven approaches (Neural Rendering, 3D Gaussian Splatting).
